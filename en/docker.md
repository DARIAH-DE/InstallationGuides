# Installation Guide: Docker

![Docker Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Docker_%28container_engine%29_logo.png)

[Docker](https://www.docker.com) is an [open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model) that wraps up software in a [container](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating-system-level_virtualization). This simplifies the deployment of applications, saves time and prevents user issues and problems with the installation of individual components.

3. Update the package database with `sudo apt-get update`

### Installation
